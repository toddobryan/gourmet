I'd love to help converting to Python3, but I don't know how to contact you. My email is toddobryan@gmail.com
(and sorry for contacting you this way). Either email me, or set up a gitter room, or whatever, and I'd be
happy to help.

I haven't used Python much since Python 2, so I'll need some guidance, but I'm happy to do what you tell me
in order to get Gourmet working on Ubuntu 20.04.
